# Markov-Chain
Markov Chain application in health care (ANAP2020 Database) to pridect French medical institution status .
This is an implementation of the Markov chain algorithm for the health care industry, to predict whether medical institution
in France are progressing in the activity in medicine such as Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics, ext...
from the publicly available database ANAP2020 and after data preparation and integration with business intelligence tools 
I used python to predict the "Bed Use / Occupancy Rate in Obstetrics" which is noted "A15" indicators in the source database.
trained on 7 years of data from 2008 to 2014, tested on 2015, and forecasted for the year 2020 this algorithm has proven
